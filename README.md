# TriviaGame
* Welcome to my Trivia Game Project. I chose to feature a few questions about the game of tennis as it is one of my favorite sports.
* This project highlighted the use of a countdown timer and capturing correct or incorrect answers to questions.
* I found this project particular helpful as it helped me to work with showing and hiding various buttons coordinated with functions as well as the ability to reset a game and start again.
* To view and play the game, press the start button.
